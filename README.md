# vis_cine_colombiano

This is a project from the Master’s degree of the Systems and Computation Engineering program of Los Andes University, specifically from the course Visual Analytics.

The project group is composed by Raul Felipe Blanco Silva, Nicolas Aguilar, Jhon Mario Lotero Salazar. 

The visualization project is researching the topic of Colombian cinema, and as a partner and client we have 64 A Films, who has been a very important personality in the industry, working on films like “Perro come perro”, “Ciudad delirio” among others. In the moment, they are working in another type of products, which are web series such as “Entre panas” among others. 

While working on all these projects, 64 A Films and other film producers started to develop a common concern which they haven’t been able to fully comprehend, ultimately, raising the question ¿Why Colombians don’t go to the cinema and watch local movies?

Based on this concern, we started working on an analysis, focusing on the main points this industry wants to solve, limiting the reach of the investigation in order to produce a clear, concrete and expressive visualization. All of this, based on Tamars Munzner’s book “Visualization Analysis and Design, AK Peters 2014”
